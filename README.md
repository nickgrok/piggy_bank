# piggy_bank
This is a piggy bank program I developed while learning the differences between data bases and storing data in a txt file.  

This iteration uses a txt document to store bank transactions.  

A simple SQL database would be a more efficient and secure alternative.

This was designed to be a bank account for my children to keep track of their allowance money.
